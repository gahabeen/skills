# Blindfolded rules

### Generic rules

- `no-array-filter-map` — rejects adjacent eager array filter/map passes while allowing lazy iterator pipelines.
- `no-reduce-accumulator-copy` — rejects non-spread accumulator copies inside reducers; complements native `oxc/no-accumulating-spread`.
- `no-chained-type-assertions` — rejects nested `as` and angle-bracket assertions that fabricate evidence; chains made only of `as const` remain valid.
- `no-conditional-empty-object-spread` — reports object spreads that use a conditional `{}` branch to omit fields. It intentionally has no autofix because omission is not equivalent to assigning `undefined`.
- `no-known-value-widening` — rejects known expressions flowing into explicit `unknown`, `object`, anonymous-object, or open-dictionary targets, including known arguments passed to local `unknown` type predicates. Empty dictionary accumulators and finite-key `Record` targets remain valid.
- `no-module-mocking` — rejects Vitest/Jest module-mocking calls, Bun `mock.module`, and named Bun `vi`/`jest` compatibility imports in favor of real dependency seams.
- `no-object-parameters` — rejects `object`, unions containing it, and scoped or transparent generic aliases that resolve to it on function inputs.
- `no-reflect-apply` — rejects global `Reflect.apply` in favor of typed function calls.
- `no-reflect-get` — rejects global `Reflect.get` in favor of typed property access or boundary parsing.
- `no-runtime-typeof` — requires boundary parsing instead of ad hoc `typeof` narrowing. Existence probes against the string `"undefined"` are allowed, and type predicates can be enabled explicitly.
- `no-shape-in-symbol-names` — rejects the case-insensitive substring `shape` in locally owned symbol names while allowing static member names such as Zod's `schema.shape` that cannot be renamed locally.
- `no-unknown-parameters` — rejects `unknown` and unions containing it on function inputs except the explicit `cause` convention and the exact subject of a type predicate.
- `no-unknown-returns` — rejects explicit function contracts that resolve to `unknown`, `Promise<unknown>`, or `PromiseLike<unknown>`, including scoped and transparent generic aliases.
- `no-unknown-type-aliases` — rejects scoped and transparent generic aliases whose resolved type is `unknown`.
- `no-unsafe-dictionary-type` — rejects dictionary value contracts based on `unknown`, `any`, `object`, `{}`, and semantic equivalents. Generic constraints such as `T extends Record<string, unknown>` are allowed.
- `no-widen-then-assert` — rejects immutable local flows that widen known evidence to `unknown`, `any`, `object`, or a broad record and later assert it back to a narrower type.
- `require-readable-spacing` — autofixes missing blank lines between top-level declarations, around multiline bindings, before control flow/returns, and after blocks; preserves compact local bindings, imports, and overload groups.
- `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion` — requires each non-const assertion to have a nearby, non-empty invariant justification. Marker prefixes are configurable and default to `SAFETY`.

### Analysis boundaries

The rules use Oxlint's ESTree and lexical-scope APIs rather than a TypeScript type checker. They resolve same-file aliases—including block-scoped aliases, forward references, and transparent generic aliases—but do not infer imported type definitions or cross-file call signatures. Rules that inspect calls therefore document when enforcement is intentionally local.

## Violation examples

Each snippet below is rejected by the named rule.

### `no-array-filter-map`

```ts
const users: User[] = loadUsers();
const emails = users.filter(user => user.active).map(user => user.email);
const found = users.map(lookup).filter(value => value !== undefined);
```

Prefer lazy iterator helpers where the target runtime supports them:

```ts
const emails = users.values()
  .filter(user => user.active)
  .map(user => user.email)
  .toArray();
```

A single `flatMap(user => user.active ? [user.email] : [])` or a reducer that pushes into a fresh local array is also allowed. Iterator helpers avoid intermediate arrays and per-item wrapper arrays, but are not guaranteed to be faster. Check runtime support; TypeScript library declarations do not polyfill them.

This AST/scope rule recognizes array literals, direct array/tuple annotations, immutable local aliases, and supported array-preserving method chains. Unknown receivers (including imported factory results and unannotated parameters), type aliases, and property-based array types are not inferred. Iterator pipelines are not flagged. Both `filter().map()` and `map().filter()` are covered, regardless of predicate. There is no autofix: callback ordering, indexes, `thisArg`, sparse arrays, and truthiness filtering must be reviewed before changing APIs.

### `no-reduce-accumulator-copy`

```ts
items.reduce((acc, item) => Object.assign({}, acc, { [item.id]: item }), {});
items.reduce((acc, item) => acc.concat([item]), []);
items.reduce((acc, item) => {
  const next = acc.slice();
  next.push(item);
  return next;
}, []);
```

Instead, mutate a fresh, locally owned accumulator and return it:

```ts
items.reduce((acc, item) => {
  acc.push(item);
  return acc;
}, []);
```

`Object.assign(acc, item)` is also allowed. Copying individual input items is not copying accumulated state.

The rule covers inline `reduce`/`reduceRight` callbacks, including index parameters, and immutable local accumulator aliases. It detects global `Object.assign` with an object-literal target and the accumulator as a source, global `Array.from(acc)`, and array accumulator calls to `concat`, `slice`, `toSpliced`, `toSorted`, `toReversed`, and `with`. Array copy methods require local array evidence for the initial value so string concatenation and unknown custom collections are not flagged. Like the native rule, reducer method names are syntactic evidence, not proof of the receiver's runtime type. Named callbacks, nested functions, indirect copy helpers, nested accumulator properties, and reassigned aliases are outside its scope. Copying a bounded accumulator is not necessarily quadratic, but these patterns are rejected because growing accumulators can be.

Enable native `oxc/no-accumulating-spread` alongside it for array/object spreads in reducers and supported loops. Neither rule proves that every possible quadratic reduction is absent. No automatic mutation rewrite is provided because accumulator ownership cannot be established syntactically.

### `no-chained-type-assertions`

```ts
const user = input as object as User;
```

### `no-conditional-empty-object-spread`

```ts
const options = {
  ...(timeout !== undefined ? { timeout } : {}),
};
```

### `no-known-value-widening`

```ts
const handlers: Record<string, Handler> = {
  start: startHandler,
};
```

This discards the known `start` key. Preserve inference or use `satisfies Record<string, Handler>` instead.

Known values must not be widened back to `unknown` through a local type predicate:

```ts
function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return UserSchema.safeParse(value).success;
}

declare const user: User;
isUser(user);
```

Call the predicate at the unparsed boundary, while the argument is still `unknown`.

### `no-module-mocking`

```ts
vi.mock("./user-store");

import { mock as replace } from "bun:test";
replace.module("./user-store", () => replacement);
```

Bun named import aliases and namespace `bun.mock.module` calls are supported,
including literal computed properties. Ordinary `mock(fn)`, `mock.restore()`,
and locally shadowed or unrelated `mock` bindings are allowed. Reassigned aliases,
destructured methods, and computed method names are outside this rule's scope.

### `no-object-parameters`

```ts
function save(value: object) {}
```

### `no-reflect-apply`

```ts
const value = Reflect.apply(operation, owner, args);
```

### `no-reflect-get`

```ts
const value = Reflect.get(owner, key);
```

### `no-runtime-typeof`

```ts
if (typeof input === "string") {
  useName(input);
}
```

Schema-free projects can permit `typeof` checks directly inside type predicate and
assertion functions while continuing to reject ad hoc checks elsewhere:

```json
{
  "blindfolded/no-runtime-typeof": [
    "error",
    { "allowInTypeGuards": true }
  ]
}
```

The option defaults to `false`. Existence probes such as `typeof document === "undefined"` are always allowed because they establish whether a binding exists rather than narrow its representation.

### `no-shape-in-symbol-names`

```ts
interface UserShape {
  id: string;
}
```

Static member reads such as `schema.shape` are allowed because the member name belongs to the value's owner and cannot be renamed locally.

### `no-unknown-parameters`

```ts
function handle(input: unknown) {}
```

A type predicate may accept `unknown` for the parameter it narrows; other `unknown`
parameters on the same function remain rejected.

### `no-unknown-returns`

```ts
function loadUser(): unknown {
  return input;
}
```

### `no-unknown-type-aliases`

```ts
type ExternalValue = unknown;
```

### `no-unsafe-dictionary-type`

```ts
type Metadata = Record<string, unknown>;
type OtherMetadata = { [key: string]: object };
```

### `no-widen-then-assert`

```ts
const loaded: User = loadUser();
const stored: unknown = loaded;
const user = stored as User;
```

### `require-readable-spacing`

```ts
export const first = 1;
/** Documentation stays attached to second. */
export const second = 2;
```

Autofix inserts a blank line before the documentation. Inside functions, adjacent short variable declarations stay grouped, while multiline bindings and control-flow boundaries receive spacing. Adjacent function overload signatures and their implementation remain grouped. Existing blank lines are never removed. The rule takes no options; edit the vendored policy if your team's preferences differ.

Run `oxlint --fix` (or `vp lint --fix`), then your formatter, then lint again. The rule inserts whitespace only; it does not add braces, wrap expressions, sort imports, or infer every logical group. Keep indentation and wrapping with the formatter rather than enabling a competing stylistic preset.

The comment-aware engine is [vendored from ESLint Stylistic](../src/blindfolded/oxlint/vendor/eslint-stylistic/UPSTREAM.md) under MIT. Copy its `LICENSE` and provenance along with the code; no third-party plugin dependency is needed.

### `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion`

```ts
const userId = value as UserId;
```

Add a specific justification immediately before a necessary assertion:

```ts
// SAFETY: parseUserId validated the identifier before branding it.
const userId = value as UserId;
```

`SAFETY` remains the default marker. Comments immediately above exported declarations are recognized. Repositories with an established convention can configure one or more alternatives; every marker must still be followed by a colon and a non-empty justification:

```json
{
  "blindfolded/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion": [
    "error",
    { "markers": ["INVARIANT", "SAFETY"] }
  ]
}
```
